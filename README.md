SPs:   Enzymatic Specific Peptides
===================================

Utility package to predict the Enzymatic Classification (EC) number for a given amino acid sequence.

We follow our methodology developed and tested in the past, pointing out the
existence of Specific Peptides (SPs) which are motifs of length â‰¥ 7 amino acids,
occurring on enzymes only.

To use our algorithm, please clone it from Github as follows:
 
git clone https://github.com/uri-weingart/ESPs.git
 
Please install the following python dependencies:
 
-import sys

-import pdb

-import json

-import Bio

-from Bio import SeqIO

-import datetime

-import platform

-import re

-import pandas as pd

-import numpy as np

-import string

-import collections

-from collections import Counter

-import argparse

-from toolz import unique

-import operator

-from functools import reduce

-import treelib

-from treelib import Node, Tree

   
We provide a fasta test file  in the data directory named  test.fasta  containing 100 enzymes downloaded from Swissprot.
  

To run:

python ESPs.py -i <your_fasta_file.fasta>
